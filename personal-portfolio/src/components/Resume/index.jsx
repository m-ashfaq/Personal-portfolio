            <div>
            <p>
                I am a software engineer that has skills in both the back-end of web applications 
                and the front-end. My previous career working with numbers brought me close to 
                my true passion: building web applications. I wasn’t satisfied with only being 
                involved in the visual aspect, and wanted a deeper involvement in building out 
                applications. In the next phase of my career, I not only want to use my design 
                skills to make the application look beautiful, but I also want to work on the 
                technically challenging facets of the application too. At my ideal company, 
                I would work with team that follows best practices like Test Driven Development 
                and pair programming to help me learn and grow as a developer.
